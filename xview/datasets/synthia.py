              faster, we resize them to a width of 640 (factor 2). However, picture
              dimensions need to be a multiple of 16 to pass through 4 levels of
              pooling in VGG16, therefore we have to crop the image a little bit in
              height and end up at a size of 640x368
            - Resizing is done with boilinear interpolation for RGB and taking the upper-
              left corner of every group of pixels for depth and label.
            - Labels are stored in a crude version of the png format. We open this,
              extract the label integer from the first channel (we omit the item ID as we
              do not use it) and store it as numpy file.
            - From the available images, we select a random 20% sample as a test-set and
              store the indexes of the train/test split so they are consistent between
              training runs.
